## Quick Start

The bot works both in **Telegram** and **Discord** — interfaces and commands are as similar as possible.

- **In Telegram:** all commands start with the letter `k` (for example, `k menu`, `k bal`, `k demo`, etc.).
- **In Discord:** use the familiar `!` prefix (for example, `!menu`, `!balance`, `!demotivator`).

## Important

**All responsibility for using this bot and all generated content and messages lies solely with the users themselves.**  
As the author and developer, I take no responsibility for the actions of the bot, the content of messages, or any consequences of its use.  
Use at your own risk.

**Kate Artivian is a completely fictional character.**  
Her persona and photos were generated by a neural network.  
Any resemblance to real people, names, or events is purely coincidental and unintended.

**Please note:**  
The bot works by connecting to a language model, for which various prompts and parameters are used.  
As the author, I do not provide my own prompts or specific instructions — the project includes only templates and basic logic.  
**All settings, prompts, texts, as well as the choice of models and their use — are entirely up to the user.**  
Therefore, responsibility for the final functionality, behavior, and all content generated by the bot rests solely with the user who configures and uses the bot.
